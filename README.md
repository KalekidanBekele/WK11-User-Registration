# Important Steps to Takes to Setup
-----------------------------------------------
To get started

- you must have yarn, mysql, and node installed
- create local db named custom_auth_tutorial
- yarn install
- yarn start

You have to change the config.json file to
match you username, password, and host to your
database.
Run npm install to install all the packages
needed.
Also, create the database "custom_auth_tutorial"
before using:
npm run dev
